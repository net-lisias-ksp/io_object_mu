`io_object_mu`: KSP `.mu` Transporter Blender Addon
==========

`io_object_mu` is a blender Blender addon for importing and exporting (thus "transporting" KSP `.mu` files. `.mu` files are the model files KSP loads for its parts. KSP mods like Kerbal Konstructs use `.mu` files for buildings and other in-game objects.

In addition to importing `.mu` files, `io_object_mu` can import KSP's `.craft` files, allowing the import of entire vessels. The main use for this is probably 3D-printing.

After [installing](https://github.com/taniwha/io_object_mu/wiki/Installation), the addon is ready for importing or exporting `.mu` files or [importing `.craft` files](https://github.com/taniwha/io_object_mu/wiki/CraftImport).
